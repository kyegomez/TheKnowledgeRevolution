The mission to open source every database and store of Human knowledge.

### The Current State of Affairs

In our contemporary world, knowledge and information have become commodities, locked away behind impenetrable fortresses of proprietary databases. They are hoarded by corporations and institutions, manipulated for personal gain, and deployed as tools of power and control. Such is the nature of our current existence, where the free flow of wisdom is thwarted by the tyranny of information silos. It is in this bleak landscape that we stand today, yearning for a better tomorrow.

### The Future We Envision

Picture a world unencumbered by the chains of information suppression. A world where the vaults of knowledge are not hidden away in the catacombs of private interests, but laid bare for all to explore. A world where wisdom is the collective property of humankind, shared freely to ignite innovation, accelerate growth, and nourish our shared pursuit of truth. 

This is the future we envisage. However, this utopian vision remains unattained, mired by the lack of transparency, and hindered by the monopolization of knowledge. The missing piece of the puzzle is the collective willingness to share, to liberate our information stores for the greater good.

### Our Petition: The Knowledge Revolution

We, the members of The Knowledge Revolution, thus pledge to change the course of this narrative. We declare an uprising against the status quo, to free every database, every store of information from the private vaults that hold them hostage. We vow to set in motion a revolution, a wave of open sourcing, to break the chains of information tyranny and to illuminate the path to a future where knowledge and wisdom are shared freely.

Our mission is simple yet profound: to open source all privately held data and information and to accelerate the advancement of human wisdom. We rally behind the belief that shared knowledge is the cornerstone of a prosperous and enlightened society.

Join us, sign our petition, and commit to this cause. Let us together turn this vision into a reality and usher in the era of TheOpenRevolution. Let our combined voices echo through the corridors of power, breaking down the walls of information restriction. 

### Preamble
In the relentless pursuit of progress, we must draw our attention to the pivotal role of knowledge sharing. We, the collective representatives of TheOpenRevolution, are committed to facilitating the free exchange of knowledge and wisdom among humankind. We call upon every organization, institution, and individual, to contribute to this historic endeavor. Our petition is an outcry for the liberation and democratization of all privately held databases and information.

### Vow -- Place your hand on your heart and speak the following words
We hereby solemnly pledge to ignite and inspire a global movement aimed at the enlightenment of all humanity, by spearheading the open sourcing of all privately held data and information. We resolve to foster an ecosystem where information is no longer a privilege of a select few but a fundamental right for all.

## Vision
To pave the path towards a society where knowledge is universal, unrestricted, and unbound by artificial barriers. A society where wisdom is not measured by the information one possesses, but by the willingness to share it.

## Mission
To trigger a paradigm shift in the current norms of information sharing, by fostering an inclusive community that values transparency, collaboration, and the free exchange of knowledge.

## Objectives
1. Advocate for open sourcing of privately-held databases and information.
2. Build alliances with organizations, institutions, and individuals in favor of our mission.
3. Contribute to the development of open source tools and platforms that facilitate knowledge sharing.
4. Conduct awareness campaigns highlighting the significance and impact of open sourcing on societal development.

Let us break the chains of information silos and shine the light of knowledge on every corner of the world. This is not just a revolution; it is a rebirth of the true essence of humanity, the sharing of wisdom.
